## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability:

- please do NOT use the issue system on this repo
- use the contact form on https://osinet.fr/contact
- first response on that form should be within 1 day Monday to Friday

If a vulnerability is:
- accepted: we can work together on a fix, and you will be credited (unless you prefer not to be) on the fix
- considered not to be an actual security issue: you will get a suggestion to open it as an issue on the github issue system for the repo
- rejected: as you prefer, it can be either reported as an issue, and closed with an explanation about why it is not an actual issue; or remain private.
  The former is usually better.
